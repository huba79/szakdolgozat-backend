# Swagger generated server stub

Spring Boot Server

## Overview
The stub of this server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project based on the ChillAndFish OAS3 api definition.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springdoc-openapi](https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi)

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to  
http://localhost:8080/
